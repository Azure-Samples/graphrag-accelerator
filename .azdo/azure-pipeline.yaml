# Starter pipeline

# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

trigger:
- main

pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest

steps:
  # Component Governance does not support pyproject.toml yet.
  # For that reason, use toml-to-requirements to export the
  # dependencies into a requirements.txt file.
  - script: pip install toml-to-requirements
  - script: toml-to-req --toml-file pyproject.toml --poetry --optional-lists dev,test,backend,frontend
  - task: ComponentGovernanceComponentDetection@0
