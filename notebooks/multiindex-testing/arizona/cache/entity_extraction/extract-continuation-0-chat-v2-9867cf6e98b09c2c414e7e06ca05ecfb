Lake Havasu City has a population of about 57,000 people. It is famous for huge spring break parties, sunsets and the London Bridge, relocated from London, England. Lake Havasu City was founded by real estate developer Robert P. McCulloch in 1963. It has two colleges, Mohave Community College and ASU Colleges in Lake Havasu City.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThe United States Census Bureau records Arizona's population as 7,151,502 in the 2020 census, a 12% increase since the 2010 United States census.Arizona remained sparsely settled for most of the 19th century. The 1860 census reported the population of \"Arizona County\" to be 6,482, of whom 4,040 were listed as \"Indians\", 21 as \"free colored\", and 2,421 as \"white\". Arizona's continued population growth puts an enormous stress on the state's water supply. As of 2011, 61% of Arizona's children under age one belonged to racial groups of color. The population of metropolitan Phoenix increased by 45% from 1991 through 2001, helping to make Arizona the second fastest-growing state in the U.S. in the 1990s (the fastest was Nevada). As of July 2018, the population of the Phoenix area is estimated to be over 4.9 million.\nAccording to the 2010 United States census, Arizona had a population of 6,392,017. In 2010, illegal immigrants constituted an estimated 8% of the population. This was the second highest percentage of any state in the U.S.Metropolitan Phoenix (4.7 million) and Tucson (1.0 million) are home to about five-sixths of Arizona's people (as of the 2010 census). Metro Phoenix alone accounts for two-thirds of the state's population.\nAccording to HUD's 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were an estimated 13,553 homeless people in Arizona.In 2018, The top countries of origin for Arizona's immigrants were Mexico, Canada, India, the Philippines and China.\n\n\n=== Race and ethnicity ===\n\n\n=== Languages ===\nAs of 2010, 73% (4,215,749) of Arizona residents age five and older spoke only English at home, while 21% (1,202,638) spoke Spanish, 2% (85,602) Navajo, <1% (22,592) German, <1% (22,426) Chinese (which includes Mandarin), <1% (19,015) Tagalog, <1% (17,603) Vietnamese, <1% (15,707) Other North American Indigenous Languages (especially indigenous languages of Arizona), and French was spoken as a main language by <1% (15,062) of the population over the age of five. In total, 27% (1,567,548) of Arizona's population age five and older spoke a mother language other than English.Arizona is home to the largest number of speakers of Native American languages in the 48 contiguous states, as more than 85,000 individuals reported speaking Navajo, and 10,403 people reported Apache, as a language spoken at home in 2005. Arizona's Apache County has the highest concentration of speakers of Native American Indian languages in the United States.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nThe 2010 U.S. Religion Census: Religious Congregations & Membership Study by ARDA reported that the three largest denominational groups in Arizona were the Catholic Church, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and non-denominational Evangelical Protestants. The Catholic Church had the highest number of adherents in Arizona (at 930,001), followed by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints with 392,918 members reported and then non-denominational Evangelical Protestant churches, reporting 281,105 adherents. The religious body with the largest number of congregations is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (with 811 congregations) followed by the Southern Baptist Convention (with 323 congregations). This census accounted for about 2.4 million of Arizona's 6.4 million residents in 2010.\nAccording to the Association of Religion Data Archives, the fifteen largest denominations by number of adherents in 2010 and 2000 were:\nHinduism became the largest non-Christian religion (when combining all denominations) in 2010 with more than 32,000 adherents, followed by Judaism with more than 20,000 and Buddhism with more than 19,000.By the publication of the Public Religion Research Institute's 2020 study, 68% of the population identified as Christian. At the Pew Research Center's 2014 study, 67% of Arizona was Christian. Among the irreligious population from 2014 to 2020 per both studies, they have decreased from 27% of the population to 24% of self-identified irreligious or agnostic Arizonans. Additionally, a third separate study by the Association of Religion Data Archives in 2020 determined Christianity as the dominant religion in the state, with Catholics numbering 1,522,410 adherents and non-denominational Christians increasing to 402,842 Arizonan Christians.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe 2020 total gross state product was $373 billion. The composition of the state's economy is moderately diverse, although health care, transportation and the government remain the largest sectors.The state's per capita income is $40,828, ranking 39th in the U.S. The state had a median household income of $50,\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MOHAVE COUNTY<|>GEO<|>Mohave County is known as \"Arizona's playground\" and is developed on the Colorado River)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAKE HAVASU<|>GEO<|>Lake Havasu is the namesake of Lake Havasu City)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAKE HAVASU CITY<|>GEO<|>Lake Havasu City is a city with a population of about 57,000 people, famous for spring break parties, sunsets, and the London Bridge)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LONDON BRIDGE<|>GEO<|>The London Bridge was relocated from London, England to Lake Havasu City)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROBERT P.
