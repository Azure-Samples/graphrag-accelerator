# Launch Instructions

1. Deploy the GraphRAG solution accelerator.
Follow instructions from the [deployment guide](../docs/DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md) to deploy a full instance of the solution accelerator.

2. Create a `.env` file with the following environment variables defined:

| Variable Name | Description |
| :--- | ---: |
DEPLOYMENT_URL        | Base url of the deployed graphrag API. Also referred to as the APIM Gateway URL.
APIM_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY | A subscription key generated by APIM.
DEPLOYER_EMAIL        | (optional) The email address of the person/organization that deployed the solution accelerator. Will default to `deployer@email.com`.

The frontend application is a simple streamlit app meant to demonstrate how to build a UI on top of the solution accelerator API. It can run as a docker container locally:
```
# cd to the root directory of the repo
> docker build -t graphrag:frontend -f docker/Dockerfile-frontend .
> docker run --env-file <env_file> -p 8080:8080 graphrag:frontend
```
To access the app , visit `localhost:8080` in your browser.

This UI application can also be hosted in Azure as a [Web App](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/app-service/web) for example.
