[![Open in Dev Containers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Dev%20Containers&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/Azure-Samples/graphrag-accelerator)

Welcome to the GraphRAG solution accelerator! This accelerator builds on top of the [graphrag](https://github.com/microsoft/graphrag) python package and exposes API endpoints hosted on Azure, which can be used to trigger indexing pipelines and enable querying of the graphrag knowledge graph.

For FAQ, access instructions, and our roadmap, please visit `aka.ms/graphrag`
