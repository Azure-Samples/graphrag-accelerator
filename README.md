Welcome to the GraphRAG solution accelerator! This accelerator builds on top of the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/graphrag" target="_blank">graphrag</a> python package and exposes API endpoints hosted on Azure, which can be used to trigger indexing pipelines and enable querying of the graphrag knowledge graph.
